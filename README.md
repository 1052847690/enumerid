## Description
I created enumerid to help determine valid ranges in an environment after getting the intial foothold. Enumerid works by connecting over RPC and enumerating the Domain Computers group and then performing an IP lookup for the given hostname. If the host has a leased IP, you will get a resolution. This gives attackers the ability to more easily orient themselves in the network.

Rather than limiting the user to a single RID I decided to make it a bit more open ended and allow the user to specify arbitrary RIDs with the option to perform DNS resolution. So this script ended up being a more evolved version of enum4linux. The benefit of enumerid is that you can theoretically compile it into an exe and run it on Windows, although I have not personally tested this.

If no password is specified, you will be prompted for one. This script requires credentials. Commonly used RIDs can be displayed with the -h option.

## Output
![enumerid example](example/enumerid_example.png "enumerid example")

## Requirements
The impacket library is required in order to run this script.
```
pip2 install impacket
```

If that fails, you can get the library from here.

## Example Usage:
Enumerate domain computers with DNS resolution:
```
./enumerid.py domain/username:password@<DC IP> -r 515 -d
```
Enumerate domain controllers without DNS resolution:
```
./enumerid.py domain/username:password@<DC IP> -r 516
```
Enumerate domain admins:
```
./enumerid.py domain/username:password@<DC IP> -r 512
```
